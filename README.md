## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed solution
Kisan shakthi - The Smart Digital Agronomist
The Kisan Saathi platform is designed as a modular system to address the farmers' lack of real-time, personalized, and multilingual advisory services.

Core Components
Multilingual Chatbot/Voice Assistant:

Interface: Primary communication channel via a simple mobile app interface and WhatsApp integration for high accessibility.

Functionality: Farmers can ask questions in their native language (e.g., Punjabi, Hindi, etc.) using voice input. The system will use ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) to convert voice to text, a Large Language Model (LLM) for intent recognition and content retrieval, and TTS (Text-to-Speech) to respond with advisory in the native language.

AI-Powered Crop & Soil Advisory Engine:

Crop Selection: Recommends the most suitable crop based on the farmer's land location (GPS), soil type/health data (user input/pre-fed data), current/predicted weather, and historical yield data.

Fertilizer and Nutrient Guidance: Provides precise, crop-stage-specific recommendations for NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and micronutrients, promoting optimal use and reducing waste.

Visual Diagnostics Module (Pest/Disease Detection):

Allows farmers to upload an image of a diseased leaf or pest. A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model will instantly detect and classify the pest/disease and provide an immediate, localized, and chemical-optimized treatment protocol.

Real-Time Alerts and Market Linkage:

Weather Alerts: Provides hyper-local, 5-day weather forecasts and predictive alerts (e.g., "Heavy rain expected in 12 hours, postpone spraying").

Market Price Tracking: Displays real-time wholesale market (Mandi) prices for the farmer's crops in nearby and major markets to aid in informed selling decisions.

How it Addresses the Problem
Problem Area	Solution Feature	Impact
Reliance on Guesswork/Third Parties	AI-Powered Advisory Engine and Voice Support	Provides personalized, science-backed advice, reducing dependency on unreliable sources and increasing farmer confidence.
Poor Yield / Excessive Input Costs	Precise Soil/Fertilizer Guidance and Pest/Disease Detection	Leads to targeted use of inputs (fertilizer, water, pesticides), minimizing overuse of chemicals and maximizing yield per unit area.
Language Barriers/Low Digital Literacy	Multilingual Voice Assistant and WhatsApp Chatbot	Makes the solution accessible to the 86% of farmers who are small/marginal and may not be fluent in written English or regional text.
Lack of Real-Time Information	Satellite Imagery, Weather APIs, and Real-Time Alerts	Allows farmers to make timely interventions (irrigation, harvesting, spraying) based on live, predicted conditions.

Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution
Holistic Voice-First Model: Integrating advanced ASR/TTS for multiple regional languages (especially Punjabi for the problem creater's region) directly into a lightweight, data-efficient chatbot interface (e.g., WhatsApp). This is a game-changer for low-literacy users.

Preventive/Predictive Advisory Loop: Integrating long-term local weather prediction and satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with crop models to offer preventive advice (e.g., "Your crop health is slightly dipping in Block B, check for a fungal infection") rather than just reactive treatment protocols.

Crowdsourced and Expert Feedback Loop: Allow agricultural extension officers to view and validate/add nuances to AI-generated advisories in a designated portal, creating a robust, hybrid advisory system that blends AI efficiency with local human expertise.
